      <h1>" Good morning "</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I am Ry Vorovath, a motivated and hardworking student with strong
        communication skills and a solid foundation in computer technology. I
        have experience in customer service, phone sales, and IT support, giving
        me confidence in problem-solving, teamwork, and working with different
        types of people. I recently completed Grade 12 and am continuing my
        studies in Information Technology at the National University of
        Management. I have also achieved strong results in English through the
        Cambridge Assessment. My goal is to grow in the technology
        field—especially in IT support, software, and digital skills—while
        continuously improving myself through learning and real-world
        experience.
